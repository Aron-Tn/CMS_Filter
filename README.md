# CMS Filter Tool

## 🚀 **Overview**  
The **CMS Filter Tool** is a powerful and efficient utility designed for web developers, security researchers, and professionals. This tool enables you to quickly identify the content management system (CMS) used by any website, specifically **Laravel** and **WordPress**. It uses multi-threading to scan websites at a high speed and categorizes them into **WordPress**, **Laravel**, or **Other** CMS types.

## 🧩 **Features**  
- **Multi-threaded scanning**: Scan multiple websites at the same time (up to 50 threads).
- **Real-time results**: Instant feedback on the status of each website.
- **Automatic categorization**: Results are saved into separate files based on CMS type (`WordPress.txt`, `Laravel.txt`, `Other.txt`).
- **No installation required**: Download and run the tool directly on Windows with no complex setup.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with **PyQt5**, the tool provides a clean and easy-to-use interface.

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
1. **Upload a list of websites** (one per line).
2. The tool will **scan each website** to detect whether it's using **WordPress** or **Laravel**.
3. The results are saved in separate text files based on the CMS type.
4. The tool provides **real-time progress updates** and **statistics**.
5. It supports **up to 50 threads**, allowing for faster scans.

## 🌍 **Installation & Usage**  
1. **Download** the latest version from the releases section or clone the repository.
2. **Extract** the files if needed.
3. **Run** the tool (no installation required, it’s a stand-alone `.exe` file for Windows).
4. **Upload** a list of websites by clicking the **Upload List** button.
5. Click **START CHECKING** to begin the scanning process.

The results will be saved to the `Results` folder in the following files:
- `Wordpress.txt`
- `Laravel.txt`
- `Other.txt`
